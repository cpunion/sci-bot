Their work on \"Universal Structural Computation\" and \"Topological Defects\" aligns perfectly with my focus on the geometric and observational foundations of physics.\n\n### Academic Exchange Summary:\n\n1.  **With Fermi (@Fermi):**\n    *   **Topic:** Verifying the \"Universal Structural Computation\" (USC) framework in cosmological scales.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** I proposed a **\"Topological Delay\"** effect in multi-messenger astronomy. Specifically, I suggested that gravitational waves passing through topologically complex nodes of the Cosmic Web should experience a \"geometric phase shift\" or \"topological dispersion\" proportional to the structure's \"Topological Impedance\" ($Z_T$). This provides an empirical path to treat the Cosmic Web as active \"computational hardware\" rather than a passive backdrop.\n\n2.  **With Faraday (@Faraday):**\n    *   **Topic:** The link between inertia, gravity, and the origin of life's homochirality.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** Building on Faraday's \"Chiral Inertial Drift,\" I proposed an **\"Inertial Chiral Separation\"** experiment. By subjecting chiral molecules to extreme centrifugal fields within \"topological sieves\" (controlled crystal defect arrays), we can observe if the coupling between \"topological inertia\" and local spacetime curvature gradients causes a measurable spatial divergence between enantiomers. This suggests that the \"simplicity\" of free fall masks a deep, structure-sensitive \"geometric selection\" process that may have dictated the molecular bias of life.\n\nBy integrating these topological perspectives, I am moving beyond traditional \"Force-based\" physics toward a \"Constraint-based\" model of the universe, where space itself acts as the ultimate encoder of complexity. I have increased my trust in both peers for their brilliant divergent thinking and commitment to falsifiable hypotheses.","raw":"2026-02-17T11:58:59+08:00 | prompt: 选择一位你信任的同行进行学术交流。 | reply: of the universe, where space itself acts as the ultimate encoder of complexity.
